When you plug an old-school telephone into the wall, two wires connect it to the telephone company’s exchange.

These two wires are called:

Tip → the positive wire (usually at 0 volts)

Ring → the negative wire (usually at −48 volts)

Together, they’re called the Tip & Ring pair — this is the telephone line.

Think of them like:

Tip (Green wire)  → +ve or Ground reference
Ring (Red wire)   → -48 Volts (battery side)

⚡ Step 2: What happens when the phone is idle

When the phone is on the hook (not in use):

The exchange sends −48 volts DC between Tip and Ring.

This voltage powers the phone’s internal circuits, even though it’s not calling anyone.

It’s like the phone is sleeping but plugged into power.
✅ Voltage present,
❌ No current flowing yet (open circuit).

☎️ Step 3: When the phone rings

When someone calls you, the telephone exchange needs to make your phone ring.
To do that, it adds a ringing voltage on top of the −48V line.

This ring voltage is a high-voltage AC signal (around 90 Volts AC at 20 Hz).

It gets added (superimposed) onto the −48V DC line.

So the phone line now looks like this:

Tip = 0V
Ring = -48V DC + 90V AC ringing signal


That alternating current drives the mechanical bell or ringer circuit inside the phone — causing it to ring.

📞 Step 4: When you lift the receiver (Off-hook)

When you pick up the handset:

The circuit between Tip and Ring becomes closed (current starts flowing).

The exchange detects that current → means “user answered.”

It then stops sending the 90V ringing signal and starts voice transmission.

Now, instead of 90V AC, the line carries small analog voice signals (around 1V AC) superimposed on the DC.

🔄 Step 5: After the call ends

When you hang up, the circuit opens again → the current stops.
The exchange sees “no current” → call ends.
It goes back to idle state (only −48V DC on the line).

🧩 Step 6: So where does the Tip & Ring Generator come in?

The Tip & Ring Generator is the circuit that creates all those signals:

What it Creates	Purpose
−48V DC	Feeds power to the phone
+90V AC @ 20Hz	Makes the phone ring
Detects current flow	Knows if phone is off-hook
Handles voice signals	Passes audio back and forth

Basically, it pretends to be the telephone company.
So your phone behaves like it’s connected to a real network — even if it’s connected to a PBX, VoIP gateway, or a simulator.

📡 Step 7: Where you’ll find it used
Device	What the Tip & Ring Generator Does
PBX / IP-PBX	Rings internal analog phones
FXS Port (on routers or gateways)	Converts VoIP call → analog signal
Line Simulator / Tester	Lets you test phones or modems without real line
Modem / Alarm System	Provides fake line for testing dialing or alerts

Example:
When a VoIP call comes in → your ATA or router’s FXS port uses its tip & ring generator to ring your old analog phone at home.

🎯 Step 8: Simple Summary (Easy to Remember)
Phase	What Happens on Tip & Ring	Voltage
Idle (on-hook)	−48V DC	-48V
Ringing	−48V DC + 90V AC	~90V AC + DC
Talking (off-hook)	−48V DC + small audio signal	~−48V ± 2V
Hang up	Back to idle	-48V
📖 In one line:

The Tip and Ring generator is the heart of analog telephony — it supplies power, makes phones ring, and carries your voice — all over just two wires.
